# ImageSortingAI- built using python and jupyter notebook
Stage 1 description: 
The purpose of stage 1 is to build a 3 class classifier to sort different shapes with the same position and orientation of Lego
blocks into their respective classes using logistic regression.These shapes need to be
recognised by the classifier at a very high accuracy rate to ensure the classifier/algorithm is
reliable.

Stage 2 description:
Same as stage 1, however the position and orientation of the 3 classes of lego bricks are different

Outcome:
Displays a confusion matrix that shows the accuracy for each regression model used in each stage
